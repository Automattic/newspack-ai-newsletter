## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AI core — the Summarizer now calls the LLM.** Each item makes one AI API Proxy
  enrich call (`Prompts::enrich`) returning a one-line `summary`, a 0–10
  `relevance_score` (against the configured relevance profile), and a `reason`. When
  no `ai_proxy_token` is set or the proxy errors/returns unparseable JSON, it falls
  back to the heuristic summary (no score) and never throws. Driven by `Settings::get`
  / `Settings::llm_client` and the new `Prompts` builders.

- **AI core — the Scorer ranks by LLM relevance + recency + source.** When an item
  carries the Summarizer's `relevance_score`, the final score is
  `relevance × weight + recency_bonus(timestamp) + source_weight` (7-day half-life
  exponential recency decay); when it doesn't (Summarizer fell back), the existing
  keyword/source heuristic is used. No LLM call — purely deterministic.

- **Foundation of the `newspack-ai-newsletter` sibling plugin** — a team-intelligence
  digest built on the newspack-nodes substrate. This initial drop is the runnable
  pipeline skeleton + the shared seams; live sources, real LLM wiring, the dashboard,
  and publishing land in follow-on sub-projects.
  - Scaffold: build/lint/test tooling (composer + npm + jest + phpunit + phpcs +
    phpstan), the `@newspack-nodes/*` build aliases, release + pre-push wiring —
    mirroring `newspack-event-logger-nodes`.
  - Pipeline spine (ported from the `example-ai-newsletter` walkthrough, contracts
    preserved byte-for-byte): `Summarizer_Node`, `Scorer_Node`, `Digest_Builder_Node`,
    `Insights_CI_Node` (its `{sources,top,accumulated}` JSON model unchanged), plus a
    canned `Stub_Source_Node` so the graph runs end-to-end before real connectors exist.
  - Bootstrap + `topologies/newspack-ai-newsletter.tsl` (the real ingest→summarize→
    score→scored-partition→digest→log graph, stub source wired) + an Insights admin page
    (dashboard enqueue guarded until the React build ships).
  - `LLM_Client` interface + `Proxy_LLM_Client` targeting the Automattic AI API Proxy
    (OpenAI `chat/completions`; default model `gpt-oss-120b`), with a closure-HTTP test seam.
  - `Source` connector interface + `Settings` schema declaring the AI + connector config,
    flagging the credential fields (`ai_proxy_token`, `github_token`, `linear_token`) secret
    via the substrate's `register_args` extension seam.
